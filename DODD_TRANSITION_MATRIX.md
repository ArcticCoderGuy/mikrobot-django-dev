## ⚠️ Critical Transition Notes

### 🔒 Code Freeze Status
**ALL U-CELL COMPONENTS ARE PRODUCTION LOCKED**

No modifications should be made to frozen components without DoDD approval:
- Models: `PRODUCTION LOCKED 🔒`
- Views: `PRODUCTION LOCKED 🔒`
- Serializers: `PRODUCTION LOCKED 🔒`
- URLs: `PRODUCTION LOCKED 🔒`

### 🎯 Performance Baselines

**Established Benchmarks for DoDD:**
- Signal Validation: < 100ms response time
- Risk Assessment: < 200ms response time
- Trade Execution: < 50ms response time
- Quality Monitoring: < 75ms response time
- System Health: < 25ms response time

### 🛡️ Security Transition Requirements

**DoDD Phase Security Tasks:**
1. Replace `AllowAny` permissions with API key authentication
2. Implement rate limiting (1000 requests/hour per key)
3. Enable HTTPS with certificate validation
4. Configure role-based access control
5. Implement request/response encryption
6. Set up security audit logging
